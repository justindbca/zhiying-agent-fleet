"""Claude worker hook channel: deliveries reach Claude Code through its Stop hook, never the input box.

After the first (CLI-argument) startup prompt, the daemon never types into a Claude worker's pane.
It pushes the business text to a private Redis mailbox for that slot and generation. The worker's
Stop hook, which runs at every turn end, settles the turn as before, then blocks on that mailbox
and answers Claude Code with ``{"decision": "block", "reason": <business text>}``. Claude Code
takes the reason as the next instruction and starts a new turn in the same session.

Measured on Claude Code 2.1.280 (docs: claude-hook-report.md):
  * A command hook's ``timeout`` is in seconds with no upper clamp (default 600). A hook that is
    still running at its timeout is killed and its output dropped: the turn ends normally and the
    session sits idle with no hook waiting ("unarmed").
  * ``stop_hook_active`` is only a flag (true on every Stop that follows a block). It never stops a
    block by itself, but Claude Code overrides the 9th consecutive block unless
    CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP is raised; 0 turns that cap off (``ENV``).
  * The reason is written to the transcript as a ``"type":"user"``, ``isMeta`` row
    ``"Stop hook feedback:\\n<reason>"`` (``FEEDBACK``).
  * Text typed into the pane while the hook waits is queued, not run: Claude Code writes a
    ``queue-operation`` ``enqueue`` row to the transcript at Enter (<0.5 s) and runs the line only
    once the hook returns. Peer messages (``<cross-session-message>``), finished background tasks
    and the rewake's own notification (``<task-notification>``) queue the same way. The hook
    therefore yields (``OperatorQueue``): it returns without taking anything as soon as any entry
    is queued, and the entry runs about 2 s later as its own turn (manual-input-measurement.md).
  * The rewake fallback must not act while another turn runs: its notification would be absorbed
    into that turn (lost) or queued behind a Stop hook that waits on the emptied mailbox
    (``TurnWatch``). Escape interrupts the turn and kills the waiting hook, so
    the session stays idle (unarmed) until its next turn ends.

Long idle: the hook waits up to ``hook_timeout(cfg)`` (default one day) without starting any turn.
Shortly before that it hands Claude one tiny keepalive turn (``KEEPALIVE``) so the next Stop hook
re-arms; that turn is never settled or reported.
