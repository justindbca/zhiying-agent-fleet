"""One configuration file with one block per table (cmux_fleet/config/fleet.yaml).

The shipped file holds the defaults. The operator's private file has the same format
(``$CMUX_FLEET_CONFIG``, else ``~/.cmux-fleet/fleet.yaml``) and is never part of this repository:
a top-level block there replaces the shipped block as a whole, and only ``USER_BLOCKS`` may appear
there (cli_pairs is the real-smoke gate and watchdog_prompts the dialog whitelist; those, the cards
and the matrix change only in the shipped file).

An explicit path (``--prompt-table``, a test table) may be either this format or a bare table:
a file whose top-level keys are all block names is read as blocks, anything else is the table itself.
