"""Handoff notes: the contract between a retiring agent session and its successor.

A handoff note has eight ``## `` sections. The model is only asked to fill three of them
("Done", "In progress", "Next steps") into a small blank form; the daemon owns the full
structure and merges the model's text in. Weak models cannot edit an existing structured
file in place without duplicating or deleting headings, so they never see the full note.

Also here: ``read_usage`` (context usage from a Codex rollout file) and the prompt that
asks a session to write its handoff.
