"""Which model every worker slot runs now, and the card limits checked before a slot takes a card.

Counting rules (docs/design.md §12 模型特点卡; interface for the night switch and the brake):
- The unit is the *model*: a profile card counts under its ``model_card`` (claude-coder and
  claude-reviewer both count as ``opus``); a card without ``model_card`` counts under its own id.
- One slot counts once, whatever its generation: a handoff successor or a profile switch inside
  the same slot never doubles the count (same-slot reuse is free).
- A slot runs the card frozen in its ``runtime_launch`` (set before the successor is spawned, so a
  switch decided earlier in the same tick is already counted); without one it runs the fleet
  default, mapped to a model card only by an exact (cli, model string) match. No match = unmapped,
  never guessed, never counted.
- An old generation holds its model until its tab is confirmed gone: during a profile switch the
  slot holds the old model (``retired_pane`` + ``retired_launch``) and the new one, so a switch never
  frees the old model's ticket early. A failed switch rolls ``runtime_launch`` back once the new tab
  is gone, so the failed generation holds nothing.
- Dead slots hold nothing, unless a tab of theirs is still alive (``alive`` callback). Retiring slots
  still hold their model until they are gone.
- The fleet default is capped like a card: ``default_problem`` refuses a start / roster / sub-fleet
  that puts more slots on the default model than its card allows; ``Fleet.card_gate(slot, None)``
  gates a switch back to the default.
- The supervisor is not counted (its Codex profile name does not say which model card it is).
