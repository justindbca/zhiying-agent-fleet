"""WezTerm-only public-surface test (not the shared interface checklist).

``tests/test_backend_interface.py`` compares both backends against ``backends/base.py``'s ``METHODS``
checklist and is owned as a shared file: this branch does not edit it, and it carries no WezTerm
exemption either. The supervisor's ruling ("``spawn_window_raise`` / ``dock_control_alone`` are cmux's
business, not the public protocol") is checked here instead, in a file that only concerns WezTerm.

The stale ``METHODS`` entries and the matching cmux changes are impl-base's to drop; until then the
shared checklist's two completeness tests legitimately fail on this branch and that is their signal,
not something this file papers over.
